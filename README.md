Culture Cow
===========

The periodic culture sending portion of the former
[Khan/culture-cow](/Khan/culture-cow).  Can also be activated with `/culture`
in Slack.

What it means to be Culture Cow
--------------------

1) Culture Cow provides a steady drip of Khan Academy culture, straight into
Slack's veins.

2) If at any point Culture Cow acts like an annoying robot by decreasing the
signal:noise ratio in our Slack channels, it will be turned into delicious
hamburgers.

Can I add more culture magic?
-----------------------------

Absolutely. Modify `culture.py` (or whatever else you want). Just abide
by the two rules of Culture Cow above.

Where does Khan Academy's Culture Cow live?
